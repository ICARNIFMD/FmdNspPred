Description: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a transboundary viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals and poses significant economic threats. Current non-structural protein (NSP)-ELISA diagnostic assays require empirically determined cutoff values, which reduces diagnostic accuracy. The FmdNspPred package provides a cutoff-independent logistic regression model for predicting FMD virus exposure in bovine serum samples based on absorbance readings from the 2B NSP-ELISA assay. This package enables veterinarians and researchers to perform accurate exposure classification of bovine samples using 2B NSP-ELISA data in a reproducible and scalable manner.
